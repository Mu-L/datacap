## Security Best Practices

We recommend the following best practices for ensuring the security of your deployment:

- **Keep your software up to date.** Ensure you are always running the latest version.
- **Regularly audit your dependencies.** Use tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or `pip-audit` to find and fix vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- **Follow the principle of least privilege.** Only grant the necessary permissions to users and services.
- **Monitor and log activity.** Set up monitoring and logging to detect any suspicious activity.
- **Backup regularly.** Ensure you have regular backups of your data and configurations.
