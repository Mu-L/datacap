!!! note

    This is a brand new version that uses a new plugin management system, new APIs, and other new features. This update is a new version and is not compatible with the previous version. Make a backup of your data before upgrading to avoid data loss. The database is compatible, as long as the upgraded SQL is executed.<br />
    It should also be noted that after upgrading the version, you need to modify the value of the 'code' field of the 'datacap_user' and 'datacap_role' tables, which is unique for each piece of data, otherwise it will cause you to be unable to log in. (If it is a clean installation, you can ignore this step)<br />
    Execute the following SQL statement to upgrade the database: <br />
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO `datacap_menu` VALUES
    (18,'全局 - 商店','STORE','','/store','',3,'VIEW',0,1,'common.store','Store',NULL,'2024-11-05 21:18:28',0,0,NULL);
    INSERT INTO `datacap_role_menu_relation` VALUES ('1','18')
    ```
